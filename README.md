# Job-search-ai
A simple GenAI-powered CLI job search tool that fetches job description data from the RSS feed of WeWorkRemotely, takes in your resume, and analyzes it with Gemini to suggest the best jobs for you, according to the fetched data.

This repo is a refinement of the [original implementation](https://github.com/skarthiek/Job-search-ai) as a part of a two-part GenAI workshop in Sree Eshwar College of Engineering (SECE), (most of ) which is recorded [**here**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRRGok7fmUg4QlrhV3HyixOckSotxNRgN&si=8CXjm74YtscRfS1d).
